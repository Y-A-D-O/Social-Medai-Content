4. You paid for 'done for you' software. Turns out you were the one doing all the work.
5. Outsourcing sounded smart. Until they stopped responding and you still had deadlines.

### 💸 Money & Time Tweets

1. Your tech stack shouldn’t collapse when one company changes their pricing.

10. Your motivation won’t save you. Systems will.
